Day-10 | AWS CLI Deep Dive | Concept + Installation + Demo
===========================================================



AWS CLI - There are 2 ways of Interacting with AWS That is GUI and CLI.  GUI is not Automation Friendly for eg we want to create 30 S3 Buckets, 10 VPCs it will take a lot of time. So for Infrastructure Management or Infrastructure Automation we Use APIs and By Using these APIs we can Automate Creation, Deletion, Management of Resources on AWS. So For Eg we want to create 10 EC2 Instances so by using the AWS API we can write Shell Script and Invoke this API and we can directly send request programmatically. If we are using GUI we are performing the Tasks Manually as we Log In into the system, But when we use the API we programmatically reach that specific application. These programs can be Shell Scripts, CLI Designed by Someone, Python Code. 



There are Bunch of Tools in the Market which Allows us to Automate Resources on AWS such as -

1) AWS CLI

2) Terraform

3) Cloud Formation Templates

4) Cloud Development Kit (CDK)


And these Tools are Used to Automate Infrastructure on AWS [Terraform, Cloud Formation Templates & CDK comes under IAC Category]




AWS CLI is a Python Utility, we can consider it as a Python Program that is written by AWS Engineers and Using These Utilities we can pass some Arguments to this Utility like we can say these are my Credentials to Authenticate to AWS for the 1st Time and After that you can pass some Variables, you can pass some parameters to this Python Utility and Create Resources on AWS.


AWS CLI Acts as a Layer Between User and AWS API.
