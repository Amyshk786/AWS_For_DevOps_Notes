Day-1 | Introduction to AWS | What is Public Cloud ? | Create an AWS Account
==============================================================================


What is Cloud - The cloud refers to a network of remote servers that store and manage data and applications, accessible via the internet. Instead of relying on local hardware and software, users can use cloud services to access and use computing resources, storage, and applications as needed. This offers flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, as users can pay for resources on a usage basis rather than investing in and maintaining their own physical infrastructure. Examples of cloud services include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.




Meaning & Examples of Public Cloud - Amazon Web Services (AWS) , Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) [In public cloud the cloud service provider like Amazon , Microsoft and Google they are managing their entire Datacenter , entire Ecosystem and you can request resources from them]



Meaning & Examples of Private Cloud - On-Premises , Inhouse and Colocation. [In Private cloud It is you and your organisation who is maintaining and managing that entire cloud platform]

What is virtualisation - Virtualization is a technology that allows you to create multiple virtual instances of an operating system or application on a single physical computer. It enables better resource utilization, isolation, and management of software and hardware resources. This can be used for various purposes, such as server consolidation, software testing, and creating development environments.




What is Hypervisor - A hypervisor is a software or hardware component that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical machine. It creates and manages these virtual environments, providing isolation between them. There are two main types of hypervisors: Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware, while Type 2 (hosted) hypervisors run on top of an existing operating system. Hypervisors are commonly used in server virtualization and cloud computing environments to efficiently utilize hardware resources and isolate different workloads.

What is Identity and Access Management (IAM) - IAM stands for Identity and Access Management. It is a framework used to manage and control access to resources in a computer system or network. IAM systems ensure that only authorized users have the appropriate level of access to specific data or services while protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. It is commonly used in various IT environments, including cloud computing platforms, to maintain security and data integrity.

Why we need IAM - A) Secure Digital Identity B) Reduce Human Errors C) Confidentiality of Data D) Effective way of Accessing Resources E) Seamless Resource Integrations.


What is a Server - A server is a computer or software system that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers are designed to handle specific tasks, such as storing and serving files, hosting websites, processing email, or running applications that multiple users can access simultaneously. They often have more processing power, memory, and storage capacity than typical client computers to efficiently handle these tasks. Servers play a crucial role in enabling various networked services and applications to function effectively.

Sharing of Resources from a Remote location by using the Internet on a Pay as you go model is called Cloud.

Cloud Computing - Cloud computing is the On demand delivery of Compute Power, Database, Storage, Applications and Other IT Resources through a Cloud Service Platform via Internet on a Pay-as-you-go model.


--> Key Features of Cloud - [ORSAP] 
1. On Demand Access
2. Resource Pooling 
3. Scalability
4. Accessibility 
5. Pay as you go Pricing 



--> Common Cloud Service Models Include -

1. Infrastructure as a Service [IAAS] - 
2. Platform as a Service [PAAS] - 
3. Software as a Service [SAAS] - 



Need of Cloud -
When we set up a Physical Data Center it requires Huge Capex and Opex so that is the reason Organisations have moved to Cloud as they can Scale up and Down the amount of Virtual Machines as per their Requirements.



Top Cloud Providers are - 
1. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
2. Microsoft Azure 
3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
4. ALIBABA
5. ORACLE
6. IBM

Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS) - When a Company Takes a Service from Network to OS so it is called IAAS.


Platform As A Service (PAAS) - When a company takes a Service from Network to Runtime it is called PAAS.


Software As A Service (SAAS) - When a Company Takes a Service from Network to Application it is called SAAS.

Deployment Model of Cloud - 

1. Public Cloud - AWS, Azure,GCP

2. Private Cloud OR Enterprise Cloud -  On-Prem, Colocation, Inhouse

3. Hybrid Cloud - When a Company Uses Both Public Cloud and Private Cloud then it is called as Hybrid Cloud 







Elastic Compute Cloud [EC2] - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides scalable and resizable compute capacity in the cloud. EC2 allows you to rent virtual servers, known as "instances," on which you can run applications and services.



Types Of EC2 Instances - 

1. General Purpose (Balanced RAM & CPU) - T A and M Series Instances comes under this.

2. Compute Optimized  (More CPU then RAM) - C Series Instances comes under this.

3. Memory Optimized  (More RAM) - R,X and Z series Instances comes under this.

4. Storage Optimized  (Low Latency) -  H, I and D Series Instances comes under this.



Features of EC2 - (CSVDALSP)
1. Customization 
2. Scalability 
3. Variety of Instances 
4. Data Storage Options 
5. Auto-Scaling
6. Load Balancing 
7. Security 
8. Pay as you go Pricing 



EC2 Instances Purchasing Option - (OSR)
1. OnDemand - (Purchased on a Fixed Rate Per Hour)

2. Dedicated Instance
3. Dedicated Host
4. Spot Instance - Discounted price per milta h
(Dedicated Instance and Dedicated Host spot k basis per rhta h)

5. Schedule Instance - particular time per le skte raat k 2 bje 4 bje taa k saste mile.
6. Reserved Instance - 1 saal se 3 saal tuk k liye reserve krwate h
