Practical of Elastic Container Registry (ECR) 

Note - aws-cli & docker is a Prerequisite for this.

usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker


Go to ECR  Create a Repository & Provide Name to it.

Once the Repository is Successfully Created you can Select that and click on "View Push Commands"  & Follow the Below Instructions


1) Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry. Use the AWS CLI:
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 713796488746.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com


2) Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here . You can skip this step if your image is already built:
docker build -t demo-app-repo .


3) After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:
docker tag demo-app-repo:latest 713796488746.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/demo-app-repo:latest


4) Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:
docker push 713796488746.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/demo-app-repo:latest



Once All the Above Commands are Successfully Executed you can go to the Repository and you can see a new Image has been Pushed to ECR.
